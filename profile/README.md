## 👋 Hi there

I see you're are interested in LePlayer, the streaming platform with plans to rival YouTube themselves! No promises this will actually work out, but we'll do our best!

## 🌈 Contribution guidelines

All help is welcome! Check our ![Discord](discord.com/invite/cBbfz6jmkz), we might accept you in!
We won't be paying for your help, YET (I hope), but if LePlayer works out and we become financially stable, one of my priorities will be to remunerate everyone who helped!

## 🍿 Fun facts

None yet 💀

## 🧙 Where we at
I am currently developing the backend and the frontend for the website. I have no predictions for when LePlayer could possibly launch.
